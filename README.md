# rob\_

My own implementation of a number of JavaScript's array functions

## Aim

To learn more about higher order functions, callbacks, testing and how JavaScript's array functions work under the hood

## Getting Started

1. `npm install`

## Requirements

1. Array functions are exported by the one ES6 module so that they can be imported like:
   `import { every } from 'rob_';`
1. Each function has a minimal test suite that ensures that they're functioning correctly
1. Each function and its tests are implemented in a unique branch and merged into `main` when approved

## Tips

1. Use [RunJs](https://runjs.dev/) for development
1. Reference mdn's [array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#) docs for more information on how each of the functions works and to assist with deciding on how to test each function

## TODO

- [x] `every`
- [x] `filter`
- [ ] `find`
- [ ] `findIndex`
- [ ] `flat` - can be done recursively :O
- [ ] `flatMap`
- [ ] `forEach`
- [ ] `map`
- [ ] `reduce`
- [ ] `reduceRight`
- [ ] `some`
